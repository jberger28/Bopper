# Bopper
A fun, simple, retro-stryle game made as part of the Williams Winter Jam 2020! In a modification to the classic game Pong, the user controls a clown
who must prevent runaway balloons from floating away.

Created in Lua as a cartridge for the Pico-8 virtual machine. Playable in browser at https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=36617
